#Portfolio Website

My web developer portfolio website featuring my skills and projects I've worked on.  The site utilizes JQuery animations on page elements such as the navbar that animates to the different sections, the splash page which scrolls parallax, and the header text which fades out along with the parallax.  The project section also uses JQuery to put a filter over the screenshots and provide information about them such as the descriptions and github/heroku links.
